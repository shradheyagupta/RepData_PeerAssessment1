## Library loading
```{r,echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```


## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r,echo=TRUE}
#Load,process and transform the data.

data <- read.csv("activity.csv")%>%
          tbl_df()
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r,echo=TRUE}
#Calculate the total number of steps taken per day.

grp_data <- group_by(data,date)%>%
          summarise(steps = sum(steps))

#Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.

hist(grp_data$steps, xlab = "Total daily Steps",main="Histogram of mean total number of steps taken per day", breaks = 40)

# Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day.

mean <- mean(grp_data$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
median <- median(grp_data$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
cbind(mean,median)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l"\color{red}{\verb|type = "l"|}type="l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis).

five_avg <- group_by(data, interval) %>%
          summarise(steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
ggplot(five_avg, aes(interval, steps)) + geom_line()

#Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

five_avg[five_avg$steps==max(five_avg$steps),]

```


## Imputing missing values
```{r}
# Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NA).

na <- data[(is.na(data)),]
nrow(na)

# Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.


```



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
